# Analytic Hierarchy Process Based Comparative Analysis of Green Financing in Developed and Developing Countries: Evidence from China and Ghana

# Summary
This study aims to conduct a comparative analysis of green financing practices in developed and developing countries, focusing on China and Ghana. The objective is to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of these countries' green financing policies and regulatory standards and identify key factors influencing their implementation.

The research adopts the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology to evaluate and compare the green financing policy, regulatory standards, and practices in China and Ghana. A comprehensive set of criteria, including policy support, financial mechanisms, project selection, and environmental impact, is developed to assess the performance of green financing in each country.

# Findings

The findings reveal significant differences in the green financing policy and regulatory landscapes between China and Ghana. China demonstrates a well-established green financing ecosystem characterized by strong policy support, diverse financial mechanisms, and effective project selection processes. In contrast, Ghana faces challenges in implementing policies and regulatory standards.

The research provides valuable insights for policymakers, financial institutions, and stakeholders involved in green financing. The findings offer specific recommendations to enhance green financing policies, regulatory standards, and frameworks in both developed and developing countries. Policymakers in developing countries like Ghana can learn from China's experience to strengthen policy frameworks, establish sustainable financial mechanisms, and improve project evaluation systems.

# Originality/Value

Focusing on China and Ghana, this study provides unique insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with green financing in different contexts. The findings offer practical implications for stakeholders aiming to promote sustainable development through effective green financing strategies and regulatory standards.

# Introduction

Green finance is increasingly recognized as a crucial tool for achieving environmental sustainability. It supports projects that promote energy sustainability, clean energy, green buildings, and environmentally friendly transportation. The Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 agenda emphasize addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development.

China has made significant strides in implementing green finance initiatives to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality. The Chinese government has developed strong policies, financial mechanisms, and debt instruments to promote green investments and reduce carbon emissions. However, in developing countries, green finance adoption remains limited despite its potential to align financial and economic activities with sustainability goals.

# Problem Statement

Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to carbon emissions and environmental risks. Ghana's Ministry of Environment, Science, and Technology aims to promote sustainable projects and climate resilience. However, the adoption rate of green financing practices remains low in developing countries, particularly Ghana. The disparity between economic growth and environmental sustainability is alarming and necessitates urgent green measures to balance economic growth with sustainability.

# Aim of the Project

This study compares the efforts and strategies implemented by China to address challenges posed by economic growth and high carbon emissions against Ghanaâ€™s efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The study aims to identify unique strategies and policies beneficial for adoption and implementation in Ghana to address global warming effectively.

# Methodology

The study employs the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) developed by Saaty (1980), a widely used Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, to compare the strategies deployed by China and Ghana for sustainable development. The AHP provides a structured framework for organizing and evaluating various criteria, such as policy support, financial mechanisms, project selection, and environmental impact.

The study applies a nine-point scale to rate the importance of various criteria, incorporating expert judgment to minimize bias. The methodology ensures a systematic approach to decision-making in green financing practices.

# RECOMMENDATION
This suggests that strong policies and a finance framework are necessary for promoting sustainable development. The study also highlighted the importance of strict adherence to green policies and regulations in driving other factors such as finance and project selection. The findings offer practical implications for policymakers and stakeholders in promoting sustainable development through effective green financing strategies. The research provides valuable insights for policymakers and financial institutions involved in green financing practices.
